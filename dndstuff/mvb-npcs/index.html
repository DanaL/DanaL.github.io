            <h2 id="lastfort" tabindex="-1">Lastfort</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Morelet</strong> - A researcher interested in relics of the Ostragen Empire, particularly its strange language. Older gentleman. I'm so sorry about his accent and idioms...</li>
<li><strong>Parmeta</strong> - Young Synod cleric who served Lastfort's parish. Recently pushed aside to some degree by Kelsus.</li>
<li><strong>Kelsus</strong> - Synod cleric from the mainland (ie., Keyelvassa). Seems to be pretty fired up the fey activity in and around Lastfort.</li>
<li><strong>Martin Cruelbow</strong> - The Reeve of Lastfort. He seems to be winning to defer to Garnier Auclair and Kelsus.</li>
<li><strong>Sarolide</strong> - A member of the Knights Emerald. Lastfort's sheriff, such as they have one. (I pronounce it something like Saw-row-lee-day)</li>
<li><strong>Isabeau Quickleaf</strong> - Local ranger, guide, hunter. Some people in town grumble that she's friendly with druid folk and have led them through town and into the wilderness nearby.</li>
<li><strong>Garnier Auclair</strong> - Cousin of Duke Garos. His family used to control Lastfort and he has secured a writ from Duke Garos granting him rights to reopen and control the mines near Lastfort. Opinion is split on whether this is good or bad for the town. Its legality could certainly be argued because Sigrada doesn't really 'own' Lastfort any longer and it has been 75 years or more since the Auclair family has been present there.</li>
<li><strong>Fenton Merryhollow</strong> - Orianna's main squeeze.</li>
<li><strong>Adjudicator Manius</strong> - Inquisitor of the Order of Illumination. (The Order of Illumination is a fraternity within the Synod dedicated to rooting out heresy. This includes scholars who verify the integrity of texts and literature as well as warriors who investigate apostates)</li>
<li><strong>Brigalda</strong> - A local herbalist and hedge mage.</li>
<li><strong>Peter</strong> - former Employee of the Month in the household of Garnier Auclair.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sigrada" tabindex="-1">Sigrada</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Duke Garos of the Wren</strong> - The Duke of Sigrada. Perhaps the most powerful noble in the former Keyelvassan provinces. (The throne of the Duke of Hyur is currently empty)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trinsic" tabindex="-1">Trinsic</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mayfair Scolleby</strong> - A researcher and bon vivant, friend of Morelet.</li>
<li><strong>Annawyn</strong> - The Prelate of the Fane of Domita, the largest Synod temple in Trinsic.</li>
<li><strong>Mirabelle</strong> - A very mercantile street urchin, member of the Lamp Lighters</li>
<li><strong>Trellara</strong> - A woman from Rust's past.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other" tabindex="-1">Other</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiddle</strong> and <strong>Second Rate Tom</strong> - Two rum gremlins who've recently been patronizing the Hallowed Hollow. Currently locked out of Fey and the party is helping them, after an initial awkward meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Stormfeather</strong> - A local bandit lord mentioned by the gang of ravenfolk the crew encountered at the Ostragan ruin.</li>
<li><strong>Sawastian</strong> - A fey being who serves the Viscountess of December Mists.</li>
<li><strong>Hansel Frostblossom</strong> - Another fey met at Cloudveil. Makes a mean stew.</li>
<li><strong>Glimmerwing</strong> - A pixie rescued from Mîm's workshop.</li>
</ul>
