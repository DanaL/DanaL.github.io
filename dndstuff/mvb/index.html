<p>Here's where you can find info about our campaign, Megaverbrew (aka Megavernus 3)!</p>
<h3 id="information-about-the-world" tabindex="-1">Information About The World</h3>
<p>The world the game is set in is called Vandacalcëa and the action began in mountain town called Lastfort, a former mining outpost and fortress in the Barony of Sigrada, a former province of the empire of Keyelvassa.</p>

<h3 id="character-creation" tabindex="-1">Character Creation</h3>
<p>We're using the rule from Tasha's whereby you can apply a +2 and +1 modifier to whichever two stats you want, without that being tied to your choice of race and sub-race. (I'm also fine with Variant Human).</p>
<p>Halflings are as found in the PHB and live among humans for the most part. They followed the Synod, etc and there isn't a halfling nation or extremely distinct halfling culture.</p>
<p>Genasi aren't elemental beings whose anscestors lived in the Elemental Planes, but instead of the descendents of nature spirits. Mechanically they work as the official version.</p>
<p>There are no dragonborn, tieflings, or aasimar in the setting. (If you really want to play one, though, we can work something out)</p>
<p>Orcs are a proper civilization and my current thinking is that they are a bit Klingon-esque. There is an orcish kingdom bordering the old empire. They have warred in the occasionally in the past but the current situation is one of negligent armistice. Orc religion centres around fire and their religious class are, mechanically, Circle of Wildfire druids.</p>
<p>Most races from official books can be accomodated. If I haven't mentioned them specifically, I'm sure we can find a place for them in the world.</p>
