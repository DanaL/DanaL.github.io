            <p>The starting town!</p>
<p>Lastfort is a former outpost on the frontier of the old Keyelvassan empire. In days long gone, it guarded the mountain passes crossing the Stoneteeth mountains against the Ostragens, as well as the occasional monstrous incursion from the mountains. Ostrage is gone now and the Keyelvassan empire considerably reduced in size, power, and ambition. Lastfort, though, remains a hub of activity because of the nearby mines. Adventurers frequently use it as a base from which to explore the mountains and the ruins found within.</p>
<p>The folk here are a blend of descendants from the original Hüirlanders and the children of people from Keyelvassa. Venarin is spoken by all of the residents, although many families speak Hüiran amongst themselves. The local tongue has also borrowed some dwarven words and idioms, as dwarven stoneworkers helped originally open the mines.</p>
<h3 id="local-landmarks" tabindex="-1">Local Landmarks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Keep</strong> The old Keyelvassan fortress is a ruin these days, although until a generation ago the Knights Emerald tried to maintain it. Two of the walls have collapsed, as has one of its towers. Villagers will talk of seeing strange lights in the northwestern tower but for the most part, it is ignored by the people of Lastfort, save for children who -- despite their parents' admonishments -- play in the rubble.</li>
<li><strong>Cloudveil</strong> One of the more prominent peaks in this part of the Stoneteeth mountains. While tall, Clouveil is not the greatest of the nearby mountains. It gets its local fame from the near constant winter storm that rages about it. In the height of summer, even its lower slopes are often choked with snow. And yet...there are enticing ruins upon its slopes. Adventurers have returned with gold and even magic, although sometimes they don't return at all. Explanations of Cloudveil's storm vary. Local folklore most commonly say that there is a witch trapped at the mountain's roots, punished by the Synod and the storm arises from her enduring rage at her imprisonment. Another story told is that the storm was created by sorcerers from Ostrage who could control the weather and used it to gain advantage against Keyelvassa. The storm is the remnants of a magical experiment gone awry centuries ago.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="important-people" tabindex="-1">Important People</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Saroilde</strong> One of the Knights Emerald. She acts to some degree as Lastfort's sheriff, attempting to keep the peace and protect the townsfolk as best she can. Careworn and overworked, but generally respected by the people of Lastfort. Her role is self-appointed, but people see her as fair and honest.</li>
<li><strong>Parmeta</strong> Priestess of the Synod and runs the local chapel. She has lived in Lastfort for two years, being dispatched when the previous priest retired. She comes from Keyelvassa and is perhaps still not quite fully comfortable with a position so far out in the hinterlands.</li>
