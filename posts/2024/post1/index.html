    <p>2022 was not a great year for me for running. I'd gone through a lazy period and struggled with running and making any progress. Then, in October 2022 I finally lost my Novid status. After recovering it had turned cold and I mostly didn't run again until May 2023. But this time I want to come up with a solid plan that would ease me back into running. My main goals were to be flexible about everything so that any setbacks wouldn't be too frustrating or kill my motivation.</p>
