<p>I got tired of being an erstwhile runner. I wanted to be a runner again!</p>
<p>2022 was not a great year for me for running. I'd gone through a lazy stretch and struggled with making any running progress. Then, in October 2022 I finally lost my Novid status and after recovering that it had turned cold. Long story short, I did hardly any running between September 2022 and May 2023. But this time I want to come up with a solid plan that would ease me back into running. My main goal was to come up with a plan that would keep me steadily improving, while being flexible, and keep any setbacks from turning into bit disasters.</p>
<p>The obvious choice was to begin with run/walk intervals and I tried to be as loose and easy about this possible. I didn't plan the intervals and just went by feel. I'd run when I felt good and walk when I felt like I needed it. This was all over the place for most of the summer. Some days I'd do 4 or 5 minute run intervals and some I could barely manage 1 minutes of running. I recall on one of my first few runs, I did a few run/walks and then a straight 20 minute run interval that felt easy and relaxed. It would be weeks before that happened again.</p>
<p>I think the big game changer was to base my runs on time rather than distance. Instead of thinking &quot;I'm going out for a 3 mile run&quot;, I ran for time instead. Initially 30 minutes and increased the duration as time when on. I'm not sure this felt so different, but thinking &quot;Okay, I just need to get out there for X minutes regardless of how much I walk&quot; was a great attitude shift over, &quot;I'm running this 3 three miles <strong>so much</strong> slower than I used to be able to.&quot;</p>
<p>I started off running three times a week and later added a fourth once I'd built up to 45 minutes for my main three runs. This allowed for lots of flexibility in my schedule and I never had to feel too stressed out about getting in my workouts. Come August, I began to extend my weekend run into a long run and built it up to 90 minutes. Also by August I was mostly running steady, only taking walk breaks on days I was especially tired or feeling a bit under the weather.</p>
<p>This plan worked great! I'm quite happy I was able to make steady progress, avoid injury, and maintain my motivation. I expect I could have been more aggressive about increasing volume and/or intensity but I think being very conservative was probably the best strategy for me. In October, I began to do one run per week as pretty informal speedwork, more or less fartlek-style. I did fast intervals interspersed with walk breaks, of varying speed and length with my only criteria that I ran faster than what had been my typical easy jogging pace over the summer. My main goal here was to add some fun and variety to my training and start to get my body used to the idea of running faster again.</p>
<h3 id="half-marathon-training" tabindex="-1">Half-Marathon Training</h3>
<p>When October rolled around and running was still going well, I decided to register for <a href="https://www.hypothermichalf.com/">the Hypothermic Half-Marathon</a>, a favourite local race held at the end of February. I honestly find I thrive a bit in cold weather vs the summer heat and I'd say -5 celsius is probably my favourite temperature for running. I'd run the Hypo Half during the Pandemic in 2021 as a virtual race and I finally felt like I had a quite good chance to build up to being able to finish and maybe beating my time from 2021.</p>
<p>The step was to draw up a training plan. I decided I'd do a 12 week plan, which would mean officially starting in the first week of December, giving me October and November to continue building base. I'd stick with 4 days week so that trainiing didn't take over my life and crosstrain via rucking and cross country skiing when I was able to squeeze them in. (Unfortunately my part of the world is in a drought and we wouldn't see enough snow to ski until the middle of January). A lot of beginner/easy plans start with 2 and 3 mile runs and fairly short long runs but I decided to stick with the volume I'd already built up to (45 minute weekday runs and a 90 minute long run). For my informal speedwork, I'd do steady state runs at my goal half-marathon pace. In 2021, I ran the Hypo in 2:39 (which by the way is about 40 minutes slower than my half-marathon PR set in September 2014) and I selected a goal of beating 2:30, which would mean 11:27/mile.</p>
<p><img src="/images/hhplan.png" alt="screen shot of training plan from Google Sheets"></p>
<p>So there's my plan in Google Sheets! I've been marking completed runs in green if they went well, and yellow if not so much. I missed a handful of workouts due to picking up a cold over the Christmas break, which is annoying but I don't think will have any appreciable impact on my fitness. I've actually been managing my pace runs faster than 11:27, often closer 11:00, which is pretty exciting. My longest run will we 12 miles and then I've given myself a nice, long taper to ensure I'm very well rested on race day.</p>
<p>Starting with on the 9 mile run, I'm eating gels to check how they agree with my stomach. I'm not too worried about this since tummy issues from gels have never historically been a problem for me but it's good to test this stuff before the race. For the race itself I think I'll probably take a gel at 4.5 and 9 miles.</p>
<p>This past weekend was my 9 mile run and if I'd continued at the same pace I was going, I would have beat my 2021 time by a minute or two! This has me pretty stoked for the race itself: I'm pretty confident I am fit enough to finish, will probably beat my last half-marathon, and now it's a matter of how fit can I get over the next month. My eye is now on how much I can beat my initial goal time by.</p>
<h3 id="the-spring%2C-and-what's-next" tabindex="-1">The Spring, And What's Next</h3>
<p>After the Hypothermic Half I'll take it pretty easy through March. The week after will recovery and then I'll build back up to 45 minute weekday runs and a 90 minute long run on the weekennd. This worked great for me last year so I don't see any reason to change! Once the snow and ice is gone, for the spring and early summer, I want to focus on improving my 5k time. I figure it'll look like: do a test 'race' to set a mark and then do an 8-week training block with two higher intensity workouts per week. One will be speedwork (I'll probably mix it up between intervals, ladder workouts, and tempo runs) and the other will be either hills or a second speedwork session. Sometime in June I'll do another 'race' and see how much I've improved. I'll have to look around and see if there are any local 5ks that will fit my schedule. I can just time my own 5k but the atmopshere of a real race can sometimes squeeze a bit speed more out of you!</p>
<p>For the summer and fall, I'm not sure yet! Maybe another 5k or 10k or perhaps an October half-marathon?</p>
